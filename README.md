üß± Architecture & Approach
Tech Stack
Next.js 14 (App Router)

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

Structure
app/: Main application pages using Next.js App Router

components/: Reusable UI components like CryptoTable

store/: Manages global application state using Redux Toolkit, including store configuration, slices, and related utilities.

Data Flow
Data is fetched from the CoinCap API

Crypto table supports client-side sorting

Navigation to detail pages is handled using Next.js dynamic routes

üìê Assumptions & Trade-offs
Client-Side Sorting: All sorting is handled client-side for speed and simplicity. This may become inefficient with very large datasets.

Public API Usage: The app directly queries the public CoinCap API with no caching or rate-limiting safeguards.

No Authentication: The app is open to all users with no login or personalization features.

Mobile Responsiveness: Tailwind ensures the UI is responsive on mobile devices, but more testing could improve polish across breakpoints.
